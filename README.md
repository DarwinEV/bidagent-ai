## 🧠 Inspiration  
> “Having worked alongside a general contractor, I’ve seen just how time-consuming and fragmented the bidding process can be. Orchestrating AI agents to handle the grunt work could free up valuable time for contractors.”  
> — *Darwin Vargas, Co-Founder*

_So we've built a revolutionary platform to **transform the industry forever**._

## 🛠️ The PROBLEM: PUBLIC BID PROCUREMENT IS BROKEN

<p align="center">
    <img src="./public/problemstatement.jpg" alt="BidAgents AI Thumbnail" width="320"/>
</p>
_Contractors spend up to 70% of their time chasing bids. For many, this is a tedious daily grind:_  
- Monitoring 50+ procurement portals  
- Logging into siloed systems  
- Parsing dense PDF documents manually  
- Filling repetitive forms  
- Tracking important deadlines 

But what if intelligent agents could handle the grunt work while **you focus on the wins**?  

## 🚀 Introducing BidAgents AI  
Leveraging Google’s recently released Agent Development Kit (ADK), Vertex AI and Google Cloud, BidAgents AI orchestrates a **supervised team of intelligent web-scraping and browser-automation agents in an end-to-end pipeline for public bid procurement**. All with minimal human intervention.
